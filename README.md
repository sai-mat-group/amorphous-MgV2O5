## üß™ About the Study

The primary goal of this work is to identify promising **amorphous cathode materials for magnesium batteries**, using advanced atomistic simulations.

This study combines:

- Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics **Melt-Quench Simulations**: To generate amorphous V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> structures.
- **Moment Tensor Potential (MTP)** construction: A machine-learned interatomic potential trained on AIMD data.
- **Voltages**: Effect of **long-range (dis)order** on average magneisum intercalation voltage.
- **Classical Molecular Dynamics** (CMD) simulations: To investigate **dynamical properties** and quantify magnesium transport in amorphous V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>.
- **PyLRO**: **Quantify long-range order** (LRO) in the amorphous structures.
